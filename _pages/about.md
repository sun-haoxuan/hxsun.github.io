Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the [Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies](https://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/en/), Peking University, supervised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com/).

Currently, my research interests focus on environmental statistics, data assimilation and its application in geoscience. 

Meanwhile, I have also got a big idea of applying statistical methods on the astronomy studies!

I am also a part-time barista at [Café Obtus](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/CsXiT3ZWsTkdJ12gDyrQrw) and am on duty on 2-4pm every Monday :)

I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market and would be happy to discuss any opportunities.
Please kindly find my latest [CV](https://sun-haoxuan.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vita_Sep_2024.pdf) here and feel free to contact me!
