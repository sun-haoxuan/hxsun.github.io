I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies](https://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/en/), Peking University, supervised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com/).

Currently, my research interests focus on environmental statistics and ensemble kalman filter. Feel free to connect me!
