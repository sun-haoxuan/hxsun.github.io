Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the [Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies](https://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/en/), Peking University, supervised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com/).

Currently, my research interests focus on environmental statistics and data assimilation. 

I have also got a big idea of applying statistical methods on astronomy studies! Therefore, I will always wait for such a chance.

I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market and would be happy to discuss any opportunities.
Please kindly find my latest [CV](https://sun-haoxuan.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vita_Jul_2024.pdf)  here! Feel free to contact me!
